# App

App was created using:
```bash
npx create-react-app my-app`
```

To develop on the app `cd react-app` then steps below:

## App Reqs

```bash
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
```

The npm used is `node: '16.13.2'`. It's better to switch to this version if another `npm`
version is installed. So, to make sure that we're running the correct npm version, let use the
node version manager software: nvm https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating

1. Once installed using ^ instructions, install the desired version: `nvm install 16.13.2`
2. Use that version `nvm use 16.13.2`

## App Start

```bash
npm start
```
