                                I'm a Software Engineer with a somewhat diverse background. I've had the opportunity to work
                                on a variety of projects. These projects touched on different IT areas including Data Warehouse, Machine Learning,
                                Business Intelligence, Web Development, and Security.
                                I've been a Consultant, a Developer, a DevOps, an AppSecDev (what?! yes it's a title
                                <span role="img" aria-label="smiling and sweating">üòÖ</span>). In terms of Industries, I've worked

                        This website aims to inform, discuss, and challenge topics around SoftWare Engineering, Security,
                        Development, and other trending topics. I use this website as a place to test concepts
                        and broadcast some of my work publicly (most of my professional work has been proprietary
                        code, so, I can't share artifacts of my work).
